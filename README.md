Security Analysis

The project uses Laravel’s built-in ORM, Eloquent, which provides protection against SQL injection attacks. The authentication and authorization process provides strong security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the application.

Authentication:

The project employs PHP authentication using Laravel Sanctum to manage user authentication. Laravel Sanctum provides a simple and secure method for handling API token authentication and managing user sessions for single-page applications (SPAs) and simple token-based APIs. By leveraging Sanctum, the project ensures that users can generate multiple API tokens for their accounts, each with specific permissions. This approach not only enhances security but also simplifies the authentication process, making it easy to integrate and manage within the Laravel framework. Consequently, the project benefits from a robust and efficient authentication system.

Sanctum 

Laravel package that provides a lightweight API authentication system based on tokens. It allows us to secure our APIs using API tokens, which are encrypted and signed using a secret key. This ensures that only authorized users can access the APIs, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to user data.

When using Sanctum, the session management is not used as the authentication is token-based. Instead of using a session to store authentication information, Sanctum issues a personal access token to the user, which can then be used to authenticate API requests.
Sanctum provides a middleware called auth:sanctum that you can attach to your API routes to protect them. When a user makes a request to one of these routes, Sanctum will verify that the request includes a valid access token. If the token is valid, the request will be allowed to proceed. If the token is invalid or missing, Sanctum will return an error response to the client.


Encryption

All user passwords are encrypted using bcrypt, a strong password hashing algorithm that makes it difficult for attackers to obtain user passwords even if they manage to obtain the password hashes.

Authorization

Authorization policies are also implemented to ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do. These measures help to protect the application from common security threats and ensure that sensitive user data is kept secure.
Authorization Grade: A+

Database Implementation

Database Design

The application utilizes MySQL as its database, employing Eloquent ORM for database interactions. The tools and technologies used are industry-standard and reliable. The database structure is well-designed and normalized, ensuring there is no redundant data. While there are some issues with the database implementation, the overall design is above average.

Design Grade: B

Modularity

The database's modularity is largely dependent on the chosen technology, MySQL. As a widely-used industry standard, MySQL offers extensive support and extensibility, making it adaptable to current and future business needs.

DB Modularity Grade: A

Performance

Although relational databases are often perceived as slower than non-relational ones, recent advancements have significantly narrowed the performance gap. However, the current database implementation has notable performance issues due to the lack of proper indexing and foreign key constraints. These shortcomings do not affect the application's functionality but can lead to performance bottlenecks. Tables such as talent,booking, and product are among those with these issues, though this is not an exhaustive list.

DB Performance Grade: C
Dependencies

Vulnerability

None of the installed packages are vulnerable as of 21-May-2024. But this doesn’t mean they won’t be in the future. Still no immediate action is needed.

Steps to Reproduce the Issue
Navigate to the booking list page.
Locate a booking that contains multiple events (e.g., DJ performance, Hosting performance).
Each event within a booking has an associated checkbox for acceptance or rejection.
Check the checkbox for the first event (e.g., DJ performance) and accept it.
Deselect the checkbox for the first event.
Check the checkbox for the second event (e.g., Hosting performance) and attempt to reject it.

Observed Behavior
Upon following the above steps, the system does not register the rejection of the second event.
This means that if a talent decides not to perform the second event within the same booking while accepting the first event, they are unable to effectively reject the second event.
Expected Behavior
The system should allow talent to selectively accept or reject individual events within a single booking.
Specifically, after deselecting the first event and selecting the second event, the rejection action should be properly registered and reflected in the system.
Impact
This logical error can lead to significant issues in event management and talent scheduling:
Talents may be erroneously booked for events they intended to reject, causing potential conflicts and dissatisfaction.
Event organizers may face difficulties in managing and confirming event schedules accurately, leading to operational inefficiencies.

Actionable Recommendations

1.QR Code Downloadability:
Issue:
 The QR code on the website cannot be downloaded by users, affecting their ability to use the code offline or share it easily.
Solutions:


Second Solution (Implemented): Change the format of the QR code using Core PHP to enable download functionality.

Implementation: I wrote custom PHP code to modify the QR code format and make it downloadable. This solution was chosen to avoid potential disruptions in the production environment.

(Screenshot attached for reference)


We identified that the QR code functionality was limited as it didn't allow users to download the code. To resolve this, we considered two solutions. The first was to install a new library called simple-qr-code, which would generate downloadable QR codes. However, this could have caused issues in our current setup, so we opted for the second solution. I wrote some custom PHP code to change the format of the QR code, enabling the download functionality without introducing new dependencies or potential risks to the existing system.

We can then process these replies and take the necessary actions, such as storing the messages in our database or notifying the support team.
This solution ensures all communications are handled within one system, making it easier to track and manage customer interactions.
Solution 2:
 Create a Chat Room
Another approach is to create a chat room for communication between the user and the admin. Here’s how it works:
When a booking is made, the automated email sent to the user will include a link to a private chat room.
The user can click on this link to enter the chat room, where they can communicate directly with the admin or support team.
This method provides a more interactive and real-time way for users to get assistance and for admins to manage communications efficiently.
Solution 3:
 Use a Ticketing System
A third option is to implement a ticketing system for managing replies and support requests. Here’s how it works:
When a user replies to an automated email, their reply is converted into a support ticket.
Each ticket is assigned a unique identifier and tracked within the system.
Support staff can then manage these tickets, respond to users, and resolve issues.
This solution helps organize and prioritize customer inquiries, ensuring timely and efficient responses.

Each of these solutions offers unique benefits and can be tailored to fit our specific needs.
